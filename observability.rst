=============

This section describes a set of metrics exported by each Graph Sync Job run.

After each graph sync job has finished, it will export a few metrics to a Prometheus push gateway. This will happen if the job has set the environment variable `THOTH_METRICS_PUSHGATEWAY_URL`. The template `openshift/cronJob-template.yaml` sets the env var to a value referenced in the ConfigMap `thoth`.

The following table shows all the metrics exported by the graph sync job.
